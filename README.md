Hello I am jD0ng or just James. I am currently a plumber and I am sick of it. I have started to learn Python by myself. I am taking classes through Udemy as well
as just Googling different excercises to build my skills. I have done really two things outside of the class. One of those is the retirement calculator I came up
with. The other is a simple blackjack game. I hope to start looking into GUI's soon as to make these simple applications more appealing. Any sort of advice is always
welcome.
